"""Per-identity + per-tenant usage-quota enforcement (opt-in, pure ASGI).

A complete no-op unless ``QuotaConfig.enabled`` — so registering it is a zero
behaviour change until an operator turns quotas on. When enabled, an
authenticated request consumes one unit from BOTH the caller's identity budget
and their tenant's aggregate budget; if either window is exhausted the request
is rejected with ``429`` before reaching the route.

Self-authenticating via the bearer token (like ``PluginAccessMiddleware``), so
it does not depend on where it sits in the stack or on a route dependency
having run. Unauthenticated requests are not quota-scoped and pass through.

Identity and tenant windows are enforced through one batched
check-then-consume (``check_and_consume_pair``): all four counters are read
in a single round trip and consumed only if every window has room, so a
rejected request burns no budget on either subject.
