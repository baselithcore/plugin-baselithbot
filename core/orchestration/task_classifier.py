"""
Capability detection: when NOT to use an agent.

Rule of thumb: a DAG with no LLM-conditional branches is not an agent
task. Many production requests are deterministic pipelines that do not
benefit from an LLM loop, and running one wastes tokens, increases
latency, and adds non-determinism. This classifier inspects a task
description and returns a recommendation: agentic, deterministic, or
ambiguous (the caller decides).

The heuristic is intentionally conservative — when in doubt, route to the
agent. False negatives are fine; false positives (suppressing an agent
that was actually needed) are bad.
