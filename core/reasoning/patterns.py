"""
Agent Pattern Registry & Complexity Classifier.

Implements two concepts from Chapter 1 of
"Building AI Agents: From Design Patterns to Production":

1. **Pattern Registry** (§1.2)
   The four production-proven agentic patterns:
   - ReAct            — Reasoning + Acting, step-by-step with tool calls.
   - Chain-of-Thought — Full reasoning trace before acting (no interleaved tools).
   - Reflection       — Generate → Critique → Revise loop.
   - Plan-and-Execute — Separate planning phase from mechanical execution.

2. **Complexity Classifier** (§1.4 "When NOT to Use an Agent")
   Determines whether a task actually requires an agent or whether a
   simpler pipeline is more appropriate.  The rule of thumb from the PDF:

       "If you can draw the logic as a flowchart with no branches that
        depend on LLM output, you don't need an agent. Just write the code."

Usage::

    from core.reasoning.patterns import PatternSelector, AgentPattern

    # Auto-select the best pattern for a task
    selector = PatternSelector()
    pattern = selector.select("What is the population of Tokyo?")

    # Check whether an agent is needed at all
    from core.reasoning.patterns import ComplexityClassifier
    assessment = ComplexityClassifier.assess("Send confirmation email to order #42")
    if assessment.use_agent:
        print("Use an agent:", assessment.reason)
    else:
        print("Use a pipeline:", assessment.reason)
