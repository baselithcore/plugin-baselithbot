"""
Fine-grained authorization scopes (capability-based access control).

A *scope* is a ``"resource:action"`` capability string (e.g. ``"chat:write"``).
On top of the coarse :class:`~core.auth.types.AuthRole` model this adds
capability-level authorization so API keys and tokens can be granted exactly
the access they need (least privilege) instead of a whole role.

Two wildcards are supported:

* ``"*"`` — grants every scope (superuser / full access).
* ``"resource:*"`` — grants every action on a single resource.

The authorization an identity actually carries is the **union** of:

* scopes derived from its roles (:data:`ROLE_SCOPES`) — this keeps the
  role-only model working unchanged (zero regression), and
* any explicit scopes attached to the identity (a scoped API key, or a JWT
  ``"scopes"`` claim).

This module is deliberately domain-agnostic: it defines the grammar and the
default role→scope mapping, not which endpoint requires which scope (that is a
routing/middleware concern). It therefore belongs in the Sacred Core.
