"""DORA major ICT-related incident domain types (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554).

DORA Art. 19 obliges financial entities to report *major* ICT-related incidents
to their competent authority against a three-step clock:

    * **initial notification** — as soon as possible and within **4h** of the
      incident being classified as major, and in any case no later than **24h**
      from becoming aware of it;
    * **intermediate report** — within **72h** of the initial notification;
    * **final report** — no later than **one month** after the intermediate
      report (when the root-cause analysis is complete).

Whether an incident is *major* is decided by the classification criteria of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1772: clients/financial counterparts
affected, reputational impact, duration/service downtime, geographical spread,
data losses, criticality of services affected, and economic impact. The exact
materiality thresholds for each criterion are operator-set against that RTS;
this module records which criteria are met and derives a *major* determination,
which can also be set explicitly.

As with the NIS2 subsystem, the framework cannot file with the authority on the
operator's behalf — it produces the structured record and the computed
deadlines so the reporting clock is explicit. Timestamps are timezone-aware UTC.
