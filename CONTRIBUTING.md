# Contributing to Baselithbot

Thanks for wanting to improve Baselithbot. This plugin lives inside the
BaselithCore monorepo but is designed to be extracted into a standalone
marketplace release. Contributions should work in both contexts.

## Ground Rules

1. **Sacred Core invariant.** Baselithbot is a plugin — never import
   `plugins/baselithbot/*` from `core/`. If you need a new capability in
   `core/`, raise it as a separate PR first.
2. **Conventional Commits.** Commit messages drive automated releases via
   `semantic-release`. Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
   `chore:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`. Breaking changes go in a
   `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
3. **500-line file cap.** Split modules that grow past that.
4. **Strict typing.** Baselithbot is in the official plugin mypy allowlist
   (`scripts/check_official_plugin_typing.py`) — new code must type-check.
5. **Tests required for behavior changes.** Bug fix or feature → new test.
   Refactors can piggy-back on existing coverage.

## Local Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install

# Fast inner loop
ruff check plugins/baselithbot
mypy --config-file plugins/baselithbot/pyproject.toml plugins/baselithbot
pytest tests/plugins/baselithbot -v

# Full official-plugin typing gate (matches CI)
python scripts/check_official_plugin_typing.py

# Architecture guard
python scripts/check_architecture_boundaries.py
```

Dashboard (React + Vite) development:

```bash
cd plugins/baselithbot/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## PR Checklist

- [ ] `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` clean.
- [ ] `mypy` clean under the official-plugin gate.
- [ ] `pytest tests/plugins/baselithbot` green.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `## [Unreleased]` when user-visible.
- [ ] `docs/` updated when behavior or configuration changes.
- [ ] Conventional Commits in the PR title.
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or real endpoints committed.

## Security-sensitive Changes

Changes to any of these require a second reviewer and updated threat notes
in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md):

- `approvals.py`, `secret_store.py`, `secret_redaction.py`
- `shell_exec.py`, `computer_tools.py`, `os_control.py`
- `desktop_agent/`, `desktop_lane.py`
- `policies/`, `gateway/`
- Anything that touches inbound handling (`inbound/`) or the dashboard
  auth surface.

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately — see
[`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the disclosure channel.

## Release Flow

1. Merge conventional commits to `main`.
2. `semantic-release` (root CI) computes the next version and tags it.
3. The marketplace workflow (`baselith-plugin-publish` Backstage template)
   produces the ZIP and pushes to
   [Baselith Marketplace](https://marketplace.baselithcore.xyz).
4. CHANGELOG.md is regenerated from commit history.

Manual release (escape hatch) is documented in
[`docs/publishing.md`](./docs/publishing.md).
