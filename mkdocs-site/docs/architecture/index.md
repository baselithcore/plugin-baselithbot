## Fundamental Principles

!!! abstract "Core Design Principles"

    1. **Plugin-First Architecture** - Domain logic lives in plugins, never in core
    2. **Async by Default** - All I/O operations are asynchronous
    3. **Dependency Injection** - Services are injected, never instantiated directly
    4. **Protocol-Based Interfaces** - Decoupling through Python protocols
    5. **Resilience by Design** - Circuit breaker, retry, rate limiting integrated

## Architecture Goals

The framework architecture is designed to achieve:

### Modularity

Clean separation between infrastructure (core) and application logic (plugins), enabling independent development and deployment.

### Scalability

Horizontal scaling through distributed workers, multi-tier storage, and stateless orchestration.

### Observability

Built-in instrumentation with OpenTelemetry, structured logging, and event-driven metrics collection.

### Security

Defense-in-depth with input validation, output sanitization, multi-tenancy isolation, and secrets management.

### Developer Experience

Clear contracts through Protocols, comprehensive CLI tooling, and auto-generated API documentation.
