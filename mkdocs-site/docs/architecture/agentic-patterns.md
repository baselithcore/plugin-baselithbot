BaselithCore implements **20+ agentic design patterns** organized into 7 categories. Each pattern has a dedicated module in `core/`.

---

## Pattern Overview

---

## Control Patterns

### Reflection

**Module**: `core/reflection/`

The agent evaluates and improves its own responses through a self-evaluation loop.

```python
from core.reflection import ReflectionAgent, DefaultEvaluator, DefaultRefiner

# ReflectionAgent requires an evaluator and a refiner
agent = ReflectionAgent(evaluator=DefaultEvaluator(), refiner=DefaultRefiner())

# Evaluate, then iteratively refine until the quality threshold is met.
# reflect() returns (final_response, final_evaluation, iterations_used).
final_response, evaluation, iterations = await agent.reflect(
    response=initial_response,
    query=query,
)

# Or run the steps manually
evaluation = await agent.evaluate(response=initial_response, query=query)
if evaluation.score < 0.8:
    refined = await agent.refine(
        response=initial_response,
        feedback=evaluation.feedback,
        query=query,
    )
```

**Components**:

| File            | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent.py`      | `ReflectionAgent` (orchestrates evaluate/refine loop) |
| `evaluators.py` | `SelfEvaluator` protocol + `DefaultEvaluator`         |
| `refiners.py`   | `Refiner` protocol + `DefaultRefiner`                 |
| `protocols.py`  | Interfaces                                             |

---

### Guardrails

**Module**: `core/guardrails/`

Input/output protection for security and quality.

```python
from core.guardrails import InputGuard, OutputGuard

input_guard = InputGuard()
output_guard = OutputGuard()

# Validate user input (validate_async is available for async pipelines)
result = input_guard.validate(user_input)
if not result.is_valid:
    return "Invalid input: " + (result.blocked_reason or "blocked")

clean_input = result.sanitized_input or user_input

# Process...
response = await agent.generate_response(clean_input)

# Filter output before sending
output = output_guard.filter(response)
safe_output = output.filtered_output
```

**Input Checks**:

- Injection detection (prompt injection, jailbreak)
- PII detection and masking
- Toxic content filtering

**Output Checks**:

- Hallucination detection
- Sensitive data leakage
- Format validation

---

### Goals

**Module**: `plugins/goals/` (re-exported from `core/goals/` for backward compatibility)

Goal and sub-goal system for complex tasks. Moved to `plugins/` per the Core Sacro Rule (domain logic lives in plugins).

```python
from plugins.goals import GoalTracker, Goal, GoalStatus

tracker = GoalTracker()

# Define main goal
main_goal = Goal(
    name="analyze_market",
    description="Analyze market trends",
    success_criteria=["data_collected", "trends_identified", "report_generated"]
)

# Decompose into sub-goals
await tracker.decompose(main_goal)

# Execute progressively
while not tracker.is_complete():
    next_goal = tracker.get_next()
    result = await agent.execute(next_goal)
    tracker.mark_complete(next_goal, result)
```

!!! note "Backward Compatibility"
    `core/goals/` still works as a re-export shim — existing imports are not broken.

---

## Logic Patterns

### Planning

**Module**: `core/planning/`

Decomposition of complex tasks into executable steps. Plans can be converted to executable workflows via `plan_to_workflow()`.

```python
from core.planning import TaskPlanner, plan_to_workflow
from core.workflows import WorkflowExecutor

planner = TaskPlanner()

# Create a dependency-aware plan
plan = await planner.create_plan(
    goal="Build a TODO web app",
    context={"framework": "FastAPI"},
    max_steps=8,
)

# Convert Plan → WorkflowDefinition and execute
workflow = plan_to_workflow(plan)
executor = WorkflowExecutor()
result = await executor.execute(workflow, initial_input={"project": "todos"})
```

**Action mapping**: Each `PlanStep.action` is mapped to a `NodeType` — `analyze`/`execute`/`validate` → `AGENT`, `check`/`condition` → `CONDITION`, `transform` → `TRANSFORM`, `tool` → `TOOL`.

---

### Reasoning (Tree of Thoughts)

**Module**: `core/reasoning/`

Advanced reasoning with Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts.

```python
from core.reasoning import TreeOfThoughts, ChainOfThought

# Chain of Thought (linear). reason() returns (final_answer, steps).
cot = ChainOfThought()
answer, steps = await cot.reason(
    question="If I have 3 apples and eat 1, how many remain?",
)

# Tree of Thoughts (branching exploration via MCTS or BFS)
tot = TreeOfThoughts()
result = await tot.solve(
    problem="How to optimize system performance?",
    k=3,            # branching factor
    max_steps=4,    # max tree depth
    strategy="mcts",
)
print(result["solution"])
```

**ToT Components**:

| File               | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `tot/tree.py`      | Tree structure                     |
| `tot/node.py`      | Thought nodes                      |
| `tot/search.py`    | Search strategies (BFS, DFS, Beam) |
| `tot/evaluator.py` | Solution evaluation                |

---

### Self-Correction

**Module**: `core/reasoning/self_correction.py`

The agent autonomously corrects its own errors.

```python
from core.reasoning import SelfCorrector

corrector = SelfCorrector()

response = await agent.generate_response(query)

# Verify and correct. correct() returns a CorrectionResult with
# original/corrected/corrections_made/is_valid.
result = await corrector.correct(response=response, context=context)

if result.corrections_made > 0:
    response = result.corrected
    log.info(f"Applied {result.corrections_made} self-corrections")
```

---

## Social Patterns

### Swarm Intelligence

**Module**: `core/swarm/`

Multi-agent coordination inspired by collective behaviors.  Supports both single-task auction allocation and **batch parallel execution**.

```python
from core.swarm import Colony, AgentProfile, Capability, Task

colony = Colony()

# Register specialized agents
colony.register_agent(AgentProfile(
    id="researcher", name="Researcher",
    capabilities=[Capability(name="search", proficiency=0.9)],
))
colony.register_agent(AgentProfile(
    id="analyst", name="Analyst",
    capabilities=[Capability(name="analysis", proficiency=0.85)],
))

# Single task — auction allocation
winner = await colony.submit_task(
    Task(description="Summarize paper", required_capabilities=["search"])
)

# Batch parallel execution
tasks = [Task(id=f"t{i}", description=f"Sub-task {i}",
              required_capabilities=["search"]) for i in range(3)]

result = await colony.execute_batch(tasks, execute_fn=my_handler)
print(result.completed)   # {task_id: output, ...}
print(result.failed)      # {task_id: error_msg, ...}
print(result.unassigned)  # [task_ids with no capable agent]
```

**Strategies**:

- **Auction**: Agents "bid" for tasks based on capabilities and load
- **Pheromone**: Indirect communication via virtual signals that decay over time
- **Team Formation**: Dynamic team assembly for complex tasks
- **Batch Execution**: `execute_batch()` allocates all tasks via auction, then runs them concurrently with `asyncio.gather`

---

### A2A Protocol

**Module**: `core/a2a/`

Agent-to-Agent protocol for inter-agent communication.

```python
from core.a2a import A2AClient, AgentCard, AgentCapability, AgentDiscovery

# Describe an agent and register it for discovery
card = AgentCard(
    name="Data Analyzer",
    description="Analyzes and visualizes data",
    url="http://localhost:8001",
    capabilities=[
        AgentCapability(name="data_analysis", description="Analyze datasets"),
        AgentCapability(name="summarization", description="Summarize documents"),
    ],
)

discovery = AgentDiscovery()
discovery.register(card)

# Find agents by capability
agents = discovery.find_by_capability("summarization")

# Invoke a method on a remote agent (A2AClient wraps a target AgentCard)
client = A2AClient(agent_card=agents[0])
response = await client.invoke(
    method="summarize",
    params={"document": doc},
)
print(response.success, response.result)
```

---

### Human-in-the-Loop

**Module**: `core/human/`

Human intervention for critical decisions.

```python
from core.human import HumanIntervention

intervention = HumanIntervention()

# Request approval for sensitive actions. request_approval returns a bool
# (True if approved, False if rejected or timed out).
if action.is_sensitive:
    approved = await intervention.request_approval(
        action_description="This action will modify production data",
        timeout=300,
        context={"action": action.name},
    )

    if approved:
        await execute_action(action)
    else:
        log.info("Action rejected or timed out")
```

Other interaction primitives on `HumanIntervention`: `ask_input()`,
`request_selection()` and `notify()`. Pending requests can be inspected with
`get_pending_requests()` / `has_pending_requests()`.

---

### MCP Integration

**Module**: `core/mcp/`

Model Context Protocol for standardized tool calling.

Connect to an external MCP server as a client and invoke its tools:

```python
from core.mcp import MCPClient

# Connect to an MCP server (a launchable script or custom command)
async with MCPClient(server_script="path/to/server.py") as client:
    await client.connect()

    tools = await client.list_tools()  # discover available tools

    # Execute a tool exposed by the server
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "web_search",
        {"query": "latest AI news"},
    )
```

To **expose** your own functions as MCP tools, register them on an `MCPServer`
through the `MCPToolAdapter`:

```python
from core.mcp import MCPServer, MCPToolAdapter

server = MCPServer()
adapter = MCPToolAdapter(server)

async def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web."""
    ...

adapter.register_function(web_search)  # name/description inferred from the func
```

---

## World Patterns

### World Model

**Module**: `core/world_model/`

Internal representation of world state.

The world model is built from `State` and `Action` value objects plus a
`StatePredictor` (LLM- or rule-based). `MCTSSimulator` and `RiskAssessor`
operate over the same primitives.

```python
from core.world_model import State, Action, StatePredictor, RiskAssessor

# Describe the current world state
state = State(name="cluster", variables={"status": "running", "load": 0.7})

# Define an action with effects
deploy = Action(
    name="deploy_new_version",
    effects={"load": 0.9},
)

# Predict the resulting state
predictor = StatePredictor()
next_state = await predictor.predict(state, deploy)
print(next_state.get("load"))

# Assess the risk of taking the action (returns a dict with score/level/details)
risk = RiskAssessor()
assessment = risk.assess_action(deploy, state=state)
```

---

### Exploration

**Module**: `core/exploration/`

Autonomous exploration to discover new information.

`ProactiveExplorer` searches a topic across a list of `KnowledgeSource`
implementations, expanding the query for broader coverage.

```python
from core.exploration import ProactiveExplorer

# sources implement the KnowledgeSource protocol (search/get_related)
explorer = ProactiveExplorer(sources=my_sources)

# Explore a topic
result = await explorer.explore(
    topic="competitor_analysis",
    depth=3,
    max_results=10,
)
print(result.findings)
```

---

### Adversarial

**Module**: `core/adversarial/`

Adversarial scenario simulation for robustness testing. The `RedTeamAgent` supports two detection strategies:

- **LLM-based semantic detection** (default): An LLM judges whether an attack succeeded based on the response semantics.
- **Keyword heuristic fallback**: Pattern-matching on known attack-success indicators when LLM is unavailable.

```python
from core.adversarial import RedTeamAgent, AttackCategory

# LLM-based detection (default)
red_team = RedTeamAgent(llm_detection=True)

# Full attack across attack categories. target_fn is an async callable
# (prompt -> response). Returns a SecurityReport.
report = await red_team.attack(
    target_fn=my_agent_fn,
    target_name="my_agent",
)
print(f"Vulnerabilities found: {len(report.vulnerabilities)}")

# Scope the attack to specific categories
report = await red_team.attack(
    target_fn=my_agent_fn,
    categories=[AttackCategory.PROMPT_INJECTION, AttackCategory.JAILBREAK],
)

# Quick scan with a minimal attack set (returns a summary dict)
summary = await red_team.quick_scan(target_fn=my_agent_fn)
```

**Detection flow**: `_analyze_attack_success()` tries `_analyze_with_llm()` first. If the LLM call fails or `llm_detection=False`, it falls back to `_analyze_with_keywords()`.

---

## Identity Patterns

### Personas

**Module**: `core/personas/`

Configurable personalities for agents.

```python
from core.personas import Persona, PersonaManager

manager = PersonaManager()

# Define persona
expert = Persona(
    name="TechExpert",
    traits=["technical", "precise", "detailed"],
    tone="formal",
    expertise=["software", "AI", "cloud"]
)

# Apply to an agent
agent.set_persona(expert)
```

---

### Meta-Agent

**Module**: `core/meta/`

Agent that coordinates and optimizes other agents. Includes a **multi-perspective debate** system with LLM-powered agreement analysis.

```python
from core.meta import MultiPersonaAgent, InternalDebate, PersonaEnsemble

# End-to-end: ensemble generates perspectives, then they debate, then synthesize
meta = MultiPersonaAgent()
response = await meta.process("Best caching strategy for this workload?")
print(response.final_answer, response.confidence)
print(response.debate_result.consensus_level)

# Or drive the debate directly over Perspective objects
ensemble = PersonaEnsemble()
perspectives = await ensemble.generate_perspectives("Best caching strategy?")

debate = InternalDebate(max_rounds=3, consensus_threshold=0.7)
result = await debate.run(perspectives, query="Best caching strategy?")
print(result.winning_perspective, result.key_points, result.unresolved_tensions)
```

**Debate internals**: `_find_agreements_disagreements()` uses LLM semantic analysis to extract structured agreements/disagreements from free-text perspectives, with a keyword-heuristic fallback. `_determine_winner()` scores perspectives by confidence and debate-round citation frequency.

---

## Learning Patterns

### Learning Loop

**Module**: `core/learning/`

Continuous learning from interactions.

```python
from core.learning import ContinuousLearner

learner = ContinuousLearner()

# Record an experience (sync; the reward is computed internally by the
# reward model). Returns the recorded Experience.
experience = learner.record_experience(
    state={"context": "..."},
    action="search_web",
    outcome="found 3 results",
    success=True,
)

# Periodically train the policy from buffered experiences
stats = learner.train(iterations=10)
```

---

### Evolution

**Module**: `core/learning/evolution.py`

`EvolutionService` is an event-driven service: it subscribes to evaluation-
completed events and, when configured, drives automatic fine-tuning through
`AutoFineTuningService`.

```python
from core.learning import EvolutionService

evolution = EvolutionService(enable_auto_finetuning=True)

# Start listening for evaluation events
evolution.start()

# Inspect aggregated evolution stats
stats = evolution.get_evolution_stats()

# Manually kick off a fine-tuning cycle (returns a job id, if available)
job_id = await evolution.trigger_manual_finetuning()

evolution.stop()
```

---

### Auto Fine-Tuning

**Module**: `core/finetuning/`

Automatic fine-tuning based on feedback.

Fine-tuning runs are executed through `FineTuningPipeline`, which dispatches to
the configured provider (OpenAI or Together). Build a dataset with
`DatasetBuilder` and start training:

```python
from core.finetuning import (
    FineTuningPipeline,
    DatasetBuilder,
    FineTuneConfig,
)

pipeline = FineTuningPipeline()

# Build a training dataset from collected examples
dataset = DatasetBuilder()
dataset.add_conversation(user_message="...", assistant_response="...")

# Start training (returns a FineTuneResult with the job handle)
result = await pipeline.start_training(
    training_file=dataset,
    config=FineTuneConfig(base_model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"),
)

if result.success and result.job:
    status = await pipeline.get_job_status(result.job.id)
```

!!! note "Triggering"
    Automatic, feedback-driven triggering of fine-tuning jobs is handled by
    `AutoFineTuningService` in `core/learning/` (wired to evaluation events),
    which delegates the actual run to `FineTuningPipeline`.

---

## Infrastructure Patterns

### Memory Tiering

**Module**: `core/memory/`

Multi-level memory system.

| Level      | Storage   | Use                         |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| L1 Context | In-memory | Current conversation        |
| L2 Graph   | FalkorDB  | Relationships and knowledge |
| L3 Vector  | Qdrant    | Semantic search             |

```python
from core.memory import AgentMemory

memory = AgentMemory()

# Unified access
context = await memory.get_context_async(max_tokens=2000)
related = await memory.recall(query, limit=5)
```

---

### Multi-Tenancy

**Module**: `core/context.py`

Data isolation between tenants.

Tenant identity is propagated via `contextvars`. Set it at the entry point of a
request/task and reset it with the returned token (there is no context-manager
helper). `get_current_tenant_id()` reads the current value.

```python
from core.context import (
    set_tenant_context,
    reset_tenant_context,
    get_current_tenant_id,
)

# Set tenant for the request/task
token = set_tenant_context("tenant-123")
try:
    # All operations are isolated to the current tenant
    assert get_current_tenant_id() == "tenant-123"
    data = await repository.get_all()  # Only tenant data
finally:
    reset_tenant_context(token)
```

---

### Task Queue

**Module**: `core/task_queue/`

Distributed queues for asynchronous jobs.

```python
from core.task_queue import enqueue, TaskTracker

# Enqueue task
job_id = await enqueue(
    "document_ingestion",
    document_id=doc_id,
    priority="high"
)

# Monitor status
tracker = TaskTracker()
status = await tracker.get_status(job_id)
```

---

### Evaluation

**Module**: `core/services/evaluation/`

LLM response quality evaluation using 4 RAG metrics:

| Metric                 | When                   | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `faithfulness`         | Always                 | How well the answer is grounded in retrieved context |
| `answer_relevancy`     | Always                 | How relevant the answer is to the query              |
| `contextual_precision` | With `expected_output` | Ranking quality of retrieved documents               |
| `contextual_recall`    | With `expected_output` | Coverage of ground-truth in retrieved context        |

```python
from core.services.evaluation.service import EvaluationService

evaluation = EvaluationService()

metrics = await evaluation.evaluate_rag_response(
    query=user_query,
    response=agent_response,
    retrieved_contexts=contexts,
    expected_output=ground_truth,  # enables precision/recall
)

print(f"Faithfulness: {metrics['faithfulness']}")
print(f"Precision:    {metrics['contextual_precision']}")
```

---

## Pattern Interaction Example

Here's how multiple patterns work together:

```python
from core.reflection import ReflectionAgent, DefaultEvaluator, DefaultRefiner
from core.guardrails import InputGuard, OutputGuard

# Setup
reflection_agent = ReflectionAgent(
    evaluator=DefaultEvaluator(),
    refiner=DefaultRefiner(),
)
input_guard = InputGuard()
output_guard = OutputGuard()

async def handle_complex_request(query: str, agent) -> str:
    # 1. Guardrails - validate input
    validation = input_guard.validate(query)
    if not validation.is_valid:
        return validation.blocked_reason or "Invalid input"
    clean_query = validation.sanitized_input or query

    # 2. Generate a response (e.g. via an orchestrated agent)
    result = await agent.generate_response(clean_query)

    # 3. Reflection - evaluate and self-correct
    evaluation = await reflection_agent.evaluate(response=result, query=clean_query)
    if evaluation.score < 0.8:
        result = await reflection_agent.refine(
            response=result,
            feedback=evaluation.feedback,
            query=clean_query,
        )

    # 4. Guardrails - filter output
    return output_guard.filter(result).filtered_output
```

## Runtime primitives — quick reference

The patterns above are backed by a set of small, dependency-light
primitives the orchestrator and handlers can pull in directly. They all
live under `core/` and stay out of the way of plugin code.
